There he makes many friends, the best of them being Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. A new teacher at the school that year is possessed by Lord Voldemort, the antagonist of the series, who partially lost his life when he failed to kill baby-Harry (difficult to explain in short). He tries to steal a stone that’s guarded by the headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore, because it’s an elixir of life. It’s up to the trio to try and stop him.</p>

She doesn’t realize that it’s his and starts using the diary to the extent of getting possessed. He uses her to open the Chamber of Secrets which houses a monstrous snake that especially targets muggle borns (non magic people). The snake is set loose and many people are hurt (including Hermione). Harry and Ron are bound to solve the issues and save everyone including Hermione and Ginny.</p>

									<p>A prisoner escapes from Azkaban, the prison of the magical world and he turns out to be Harry’s Godfather, Sirius Black, who happened to be his parents’ best friend. He’s under the misconception that Sirius was the reason for their death. Sirius, meanwhile, arrives at Hogwarts (in the form of a dog) to attack the person who actually was the cause of Harry’s parents’ death. Interestingly, this guy is Ron’s rat (yes he can change forms too). Everyone thinks Sirius is after Harry while in fact he’s just after the rat. In the series of events that follow, Harry realizes that Sirius is innocent and tries to save him from the prison guards (called Dementors) who suck the soul out of people (literally).</p>

									<p>There’s a competition called the Tri-Wizard Tournament between three wizarding schools and it’s extremely dangerous. Someone nominates Harry’s name though he’s under-age and he’s chastised by people because they think he did it himself for fame. He survives the tournament and with another student of Hogwarts, Cedric, reached the trophy first. They both touch it at the same time and are transported to another place. That’s where Voldemort is trying to come back to life. He and his henchman were expecting only Harry, so Cedric is killed. They take Harry’s blood and Voldemort gets his body back (he did not have a proper one after the event described in the first part when Harry was an infant). Then Harry somehow escapes with Cedric’s body.</p>

					<p><q>Whether you come back by page or by the big screen, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.</q> - J.K. Rowling</p>
				</div>

					<p>J.K. Rowling is the famous British author of the worldwide attention gaining Harry Potter series. Her best-selling novels have sold more than 400 million copies and won numerous awards. The books have also been adapted to screen in a series of blockbuster films. Ranked as the twelfth richest woman in the United Kingdom in 2008 with a net worth of US$1 billion, Rowling has risen from rags to riches. Harry Potter upgraded the status of this woman from living on welfare to being a multimillionaire in a short period of just 5 years. Titled the Most Influential Woman in Britain in 2010 by leading magazine editors, J.K Rowling and Harry Potter have become household names globally.</p>
					
<!--					<p>Joanne Kathleen Rowling, daughter of Peter James Rowling and Anne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She is the elder sister of Dianne Rowling who was born 23 month after Jo. Rowling was fond of writing stories since a very young age; she read her short imaginative stories to her sister, Di. Rowling went to the Wyedean School and College after which she attended the University of Exter where she obtained a BA degree in French and Classics. Rowling then worked at Amnesty International in London as a researcher and bilingual secretary.</p>-->
					
					<p>Rowling conceived the idea of Harry Potter in 1990 while she waited on a 4 hour delayed train trip from Manchester to London. Her mind was suddenly flooded with ideas about a boy who attended wizardry school. She did not have a pen at that time so she kept thinking about it and immediately sat down to write as soon as she reached her flat in Clapham Junction.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							<p>Rowling wrote Harry Potter through difficult times of poverty and depression surviving on welfare with her daughter whom she had from a brief marriage in Portugal. She now settled in Edinburg near her sister. The first book of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, which was renamed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone for the U.S. edition was published in Britain in June, 1997. The book was a big hit not only among children but also adults.</p>
					
<!--							<p>For Rowling, there was no looking back and she published a series of 7 Harry Potter books. In July, 1998, a sequel was published, titled, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The third book in the series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was published in December, 1999.With a simultaneous release in UK and USA, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on July 8, 2000. This particular novel broke all sales records selling 372,775 copies on the first day of its release in UK and 3 million copies in the first 48 hours in the USA. Although Rowling denied rumors of a writer’s block, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, fifth book the series was released three years later followed by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in July, 2005. The seventh and so far last Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in July 2007.</p>-->
					
							<p>Rowling has been accredited by many prestigious awards and also praised for generating an interest in reading amongst young people at a time when they were discarding this valuable hobby. Rowling lives in England with her husband, Dr. Neil Murray and 3 children.</p>

										<p>It was always difficult being Harry Potter, and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. Don’t miss this deeply human story that reveals how friendship and family can ultimately bring us together to conquer our greatest fears and foes.</p>

						  <p>J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter is the most successful book series of all time, and for good reason. Rowling's rare insight into universal feelings, combined with original takes on classic fantasy tropes, and a witty writing style, take this book from fun and exciting to timeless and classic <br><span> - WordsAndOtherGoodIdeas</span></p>
						</div>
						<div class="carousel-item">
						  <p>A very long but thrilling book from JK Rowling which does not disappoint in the fantasy stakes. I think a difficult book to read in places that may not make it always an easy read, but for those difficult chapters you are certainly rewarded. The whole coming of age thing did jar a little and we all know that teenagers are wont to the occasional strop but there are times when you want the characters, especially Harry to stop moaning and just get on with it. That aside, there are thrilling feats undertaken in the tournament, the addition of some really good, love to hate characters such as Rita Skeeta, more characters you just love like Alastor Moody and just a little bit of romance in the air, not only for Harry. We also learn more about Voldemorts past and the those of his fervent followers, which throws up a few surprises and the Ministry of Magic itself is explored more deeply. A very complex book compared to it's predessesors but well written as always and immensely enjoyable with a real show stopper of an end. 	<br><span>- Amanda White</span></p>

						  <p>This is the longest book in the series but it is a cracking read, with so much going on and the pace once again picking up from the first page. This book really explores Harry's potential and his past, which opens up more surprises than you would think. The battle scenes are very complex and you may find yourself having to re-read them in order to get your head 'round what is happening, but as always, JK Rowling makes your commitment more than worthwhile. This might be a harder read for younger children than previous books but it is no less enjoyable and continues to build the suspense of the story. There are some wonderful touches, Sirius Black's family home, where Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out when being pursued by the Ministry of Magic being one and we once again see much loved characters such as Remus Lupin. This book is very dark in places and we see that our hero isn't infallable, giving him yet another dimension and allowing us to identify with his struggles. There is humour also so it's certainly not all doom and gloom. An excellent book and wonderfully engrossing read. 	<br><span>- Amanda White</span></p>
